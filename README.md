Lupe's Birds is a spinoff of greg smith's tutorial "Making an Angry Birdsâ„¢ Clone in JavaScript" https://bocoup.com/screencasts/make-your-own-angry-birds

Couple notes: about boxbox, I found it somewhat limiting to use and found many times where I wanted to interact with Box2d directly, and just stayed with KISS principles to crank this out within three days. That said, surely issues will be found. Fork at will and fix or create an issue. There are some weirdness bugs related to scaling.

I did manage to integrate a touch interface and some scoring and UI/feedback functions.

Next Steps:
It would be cool to have more levels, although I's like to see the scaling and basic game stuff (cross platform speed issues, etc) worked out. Although I figure there is probably a better more modern gaming library that would allow this to be created in half the time somewhere. (Author likes to code in native JS) It would be awesome to extend the world to the right and follow the "ball" with the camera, along with scaling views / overviews, which would allow for bigger levels. (I'd prefer to eliminate boxbox before going into that)
